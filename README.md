## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- External API

### What I learned

I furthered my knowledge on using API and dynamically rendering the results onto the page. I checked a couple different browsers to validate my results and noticed Firefox was not working properly. The API was not generating new results and I figured out a soulution of adding 'no-catch' to the api fetch.
